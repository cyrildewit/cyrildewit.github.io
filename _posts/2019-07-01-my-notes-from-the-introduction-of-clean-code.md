## Notes

Learning craftmanship:

* knowledge (principles, patterns, practices and heuristics)
* work (practising the gained knowledge)

"Learning to write clean code is _hard work_."

"This is not a "feel good" book that you can read on an airplane and finish before you land."

"You will be reading code - lots of code."

First several chapters descripte the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code.

Second part consists of several case studies of ever-increasing complexity.

Third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and smells gathered while creating the case studies.
