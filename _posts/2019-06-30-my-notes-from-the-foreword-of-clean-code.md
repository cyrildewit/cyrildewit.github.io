title: My notes from the foreword of "Clean Code"
---

A while ago, I bought a book called "Clean Code". It's written by Robert Cecil Martin, also known as "Uncle Bob". He is an American software engineer and instructor.

This book has been in my closet for a while now and today I finally had the time and mindset to start reading it. I always find it difficult to remember the information from a thick book for a long period. Eventually I forget or twist the information. Reading a book only requires me time and energy. Finding the time and energy isn't a big deal for me, because I'm always very enthusiastic about my new insights from resources and I want to share them with friends and other people. This works prettry well, until months have passed and I completly forgot what I read and didn't do anything with information.

To avoid this and actually learn something from it for the long term, I have decided that I am going to make notes of each chapter and do some extra research about the topic. This way I have a collection of all the important information this book offers. By adding references to the page numbers, I also make it incredible easy to find a topic and reread the material again.

Today, I started with the foreword. It's written by someone else, named James O. Coplien.

## Notes

"Small things matter"

_This book is about humble concerns whose value is nonetheless far from small._

One of the major pillars of TPM (Total Productive Maintenance) is the set of so-called 5S principles:

* Sort (_Seiri_)
* Set In Order (_Seiton_)
* Shine (_Seiso_)
* Standardize (_Seiketsu_)
* Sustain/Self-discipline (_Shutsuke_)

[Wikipedia page about this methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5S_(methodology))

"Be _honest_ in small things"

This means being honest:

* to the code
* to our colleagues about the state of our code
* with ourselves about our code

"Did we do our best to leave the code base cleaner than we found it?"
